        The <a href="https://www.hulu.com/the-handmaids-tale?cmp=7315&utm_campaign=CM_SOC_The+Handmaid%27s+Tale&utm_source=SOC&utm_medium=SOC&dclid=CLbn6ruQsdwCFYVLDAodP6wFnA"> Handmaid’s Tale</a> follows the oppressed life of a woman forced into sexual slavery in a future world where a military dictatorship has overthrown the United States government. This society forces women with healthy reproductive systems into sex slavery to deliver children for the new society’s richest members. In this future, women have no <em>rights</em> and are treated as chattel slaves. According to <strong>CNN</strong>, this is what the U.S. has become thanks to Donald Trump — even as the #MeToo movement has resulted in scores of rich and powerful men losing their jobs over past allegations.

          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
          by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
