    <h1>Hello Yoyo</h1>
      <p>Hey Yoyo like this tree?? Im just pointing out something I find very <strong>VERY</strong> interesting!!!!!!
      </p><br>
    <h2>Operation Northwoods</h2>
      <p>
      Is a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962.
      </p>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to: <br><br><strong>Commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets <br>Blaming it on the Cuban government <br>And using it to justify a war against Cuba.</strong><br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          The plans detailed in the document included the sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, <strong><em>hijacking planes</strong></em>, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">U.S. cities.</a> The proposals were <a href="https://www.facebook.com">rejected</a> by the Kennedy administration.
